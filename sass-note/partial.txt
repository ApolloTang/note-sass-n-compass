:: Importing Partial

    when importing partial, omit file extension as well as the underscore
    that prefix filename. eg:

        @import "themes/night-sky"

        will import the partials:

            themes/_night-sky.scss

            or

            themes/_night-sky.sass


:: Nested Import
================

    Unlike the plan CSS, Sass allows @imports apear inside CSS rules, eg:

        in file "_file-to-import.scss" contains:

            .imported-class {property: value}

        and in another file "main.scss" contains:

            .my-class { @import "file-to-import" }

    The above will generate:

        .my-class .imported-class {
          property: value;
        }


        Sass format:
        ============

            file "_file-to-import.sass" contains:

                .imported-class
                    property: value

            "main.sass" contains:

                .my-class
                    @import "file-to-import"


:: Plain CSS imports
===================

    Sass @importr will read the import as a plain CSS imports if the filename:

        [1] ends with .css
        [2] is a url
        [3] is a css url() value
