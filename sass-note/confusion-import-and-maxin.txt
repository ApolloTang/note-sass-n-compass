Syntax for @import and @include is very similar and they
can be confusion:

    Remember:
        @import are for partial
        @include are for maxin


@import example:
================

    in file "_file-to-import.scss" contains:

        .imported-class {property: value}

    and in another file "main.scss" contains:

        .my-class { @import "file-to-import" }

    The above will generate:

        .my-class .imported-class {
          property: value;
        }

@maxin example
==============

    @mixin rounded-corners {
        border-radius: 5px;
    }

    .notice {
        border: 2px solid #00aa00;
        @include rounded-corners;
    }


    The above expand into:

    .notice {
        border: 2px solid #00aa00;
        border-radius: 5px;
    }
